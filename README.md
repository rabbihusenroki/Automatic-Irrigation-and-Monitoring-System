# Automatic-Irrigation-and-Monitoring-System
# 1.1 Introduction
Automatic Irrigation Process, is an automatic and self-controlled system, that can irrigate the plants properly and smartly. It works with moisture condition of the soli. And according to that, it can control the pump that will be used for irrigation. The main purpose of this system is minimizing the losses of water and power, beside of that maximize the productivity.
No doubt that, it is a must needed system for the current world. Because the
main concerning issue of our modern world is decreasing the water label
day by day. So proper use of water is now do or die matter for us.
The operation of this system is so simple. For irrigating of our plant, we used
a dc motor means a dc pump. A sensor is joined to the soil. This sensor
always measures the humidity level of the soil, and give to the CPU. CPU
check the upcoming value, and according to the data, it can find either the
soil is wet or dry. If the soil become wetter in a certain level it turns off the
pump. And when the soil drier, the pump will be started again. All of these
steps are working as a close loop system. You have to need, just install this
system in your plantation and it will be irrigated automatically.

# 1.2 Motivation
Actually, i am very afraid of our next generation. This modern world is
becoming harmful for our Earth. One of the matters is Waste of Water. If we
shall continue that such kind of disaster, surly very soon our whole world
will be destroyed. So, we take a decision for creating a system, that may be
tiny but can take a vast role for save our world. And from that we have finally
created a system called ‚ÄúAutomatic Irrigation System‚Äù. We are very hopeful
that, our system will take a great impact for the healthy world.

# 1.3 Background Study
For experimenting and implementing this system, i have studied some
basic and important methodology. First of all, introducing with Arduino.
Arduino is the microcontroller based complete circuit board. Arduino is
Processing unit of our system. Then moisture sensor. We take a deep
knowledge on that. There are two types of moisture sensor. One is resistive
moisture sensor and other is capacitive moisture sensor. There are some
limitations on the resistive moisture sensor so we choose the other one.
Next is monitoring. For monitoring our system, we have to need display. There are
many kinds of display. TFT, OLED, LCD etc. For simplify our system we have
used LCD display. We also take knowledge on Relay. So, for implementing our
system we studied on many peripherals.


# 1.4 Project Outline
 2.1 ‚Äì Describe the method of the system and required components.
 3.1 ‚Äì Here we will give the demo code and Circuit diagram.
 4.1 ‚Äì Demo results and the application of our system.

 
 # 2.1 Introduction
 Here i am describing the basic diagram of our system. After that we will introduce the
required components. And finally, we will draw the main circuit diagram.
# Rest of all process are provided into Code File. Thanks üòä
